# Interpretation No. 1 – Balance vs. Resilience

These days, I often hear adults speak about children being too sensitive. There’s a growing call to make them more "resilient" – to prepare them for the pressure and harshness of the world they are expected to enter.

But pressure is not solved by resilience. It's solved by equilibrium.

Resilience always depends on degree. And anything you rely on that is based on degree will eventually lead you into trouble.

You can only ever make yourself – or someone else – resilient up to a certain point. That means: when pressure increases, so must resilience. You’re stuck in a race to keep up. And whoever is best at raising the pressure wins. You lose, even collapse.

But when we teach ourselves how to relate to the principle behind the pressure – not the pressure itself – then the amount no longer matters.

You become resilient not to a certain level, but to the nature of pressure itself. That’s what creates equilibrium.

You cannot be shaken by any great magnitude of anything, if you no longer have a fundamental issue with its root.

So teach your children – and yourself – not to be resistant, but to be in alignment. Not armored against the world, but transparent with it.

The way forward is not to build thicker walls, but to understand the architecture of what’s coming.

Let yourselves become fully transparent – so much so, that there is nothing left to hit. No hard spot inside that can be struck.

And that begins with you – with what you are still afraid of.

So good luck. 🍀
